## Course Description

This course is a elucidation of the theory, techniques and design in the field of artificial intelligence (AI). The course is framed around the major subfields of AI. As the scope of the area is larger than can fit into a single course, the detail covered over topics in this course will weave between conceptual and concrete. AI systems and techniques used in game AI will be be a focus in the course and will be used to frame lectures and motivate examples.
As this is an advanced course in computer science, the work and reading loads will be appropriately advanced and difficult for those students who are newer to the field. Reading in advance of the lectures and leveraging office hours and the provided course communication tools are highly recommended.

### Learning Outcomes
* Learn to critically engage challenges with computational thinking via concepts in the area of artificial intelligence.
* Technical  and design competency AI techniques.
* Express computational solutions to challenges via the use of and implementation of AI techniques.
* Increase competency with  software design while engaging in good programming practices.
* Engage the with history and current state of artificial intelligence.
